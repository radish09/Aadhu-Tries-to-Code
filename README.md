# Aadarsh-Tries-to-Code
Aadarsh tries to use PySCF and write code in Python - a modern Shakespearean comedy? Tragedy? All of the above? Wait and find out!

I'm writing and running this code on my own personal device, and then uploading it here. Anything here may not be the most updated version - the most updated version exists on my laptop and will be uploaded here periodically.

DISCLAIMER: I'm a current Chemistry undergrad at a uniquely time-consuming school, and I'm doing this for fun in my own free time. I take no responsibility for any errors or mistakes present here.
